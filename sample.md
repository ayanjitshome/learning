## Explore the Syllabus

If you have spent time in a classroom, you’ve probably come across a course syllabus before. For those of us that may want a refresher, there is good news: a syllabus is basically an outline of the course. It tells us what we are studying, when we are studying it, and how to get credit for our work. 

To get started in this course, it's a good idea to take a look at the syllabus. We've called out some of the most critical information for you below. Once you’re confident you’ve grasped the key information, download the complete syllabus and save it on your desktop so that you can refer to it regularly as you progress.

### Syllabus Overview

Graduates of the program will receive a Certificate of Completion from the university. In order to graduate from this course and receive your certificate, you must complete the graduation requirements listed in the detailed syllabus. 

#### Assignments & Grading Breakdown

Now that you know where to find the graduation requirements (and that graduation requirements exist!), you may be wondering how to actually accomplish these requirements. The Assessment Criteria section of the syllabus has this detail for you. As an overview, there are two categories of assignments: Projects and Challenges.

* **Projects:** The boot camp is divided into three equal sections: Foundations, Technique, and Performance. Each of the sections culminates in a group project where teams apply key technologies learned in that section to build dynamic applications. They are worth 60% of your grade.

* **Challenge Assignments:** Weekly individual assignments where key skills learned in a module are applied. You'll receive rubric-based feedback 
and the lowest two grades will be discarded. They are worth 40% of your grade.
